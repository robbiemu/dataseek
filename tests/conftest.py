"""
Global pytest configuration for this repo.

Purpose: Detect and prevent accidental network access during tests.

Behavior:
- By default, any attempt to open a network socket to a non-local address raises
  NetworkAccessError with details about the destination and suggesting how to mock.
- Local addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1, localhost) are allowed.
- Set environment variable ALLOW_NET_TESTS=1 to disable this guard (e.g., for
  explicit integration tests).
